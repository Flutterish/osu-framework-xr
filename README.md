# osu-framework-xr
 
An extension for osu-framework (o!f) which enables rendering and physics in 3d space. This project was originally a part of osu!xr (a VR port of osu!lazer), but I deemed it useful for other creators, and as such it was split into its own thing.

# ⚠️ WARNING ⚠️
o!f-xr is currently not in best shape. There are bugs, naming inconsistencies and awkward limitations. This codebase will undergo an overhaul and you will not be notified of breaking changes. If you build a project with this, be aware that at some point the whole structure might change.
